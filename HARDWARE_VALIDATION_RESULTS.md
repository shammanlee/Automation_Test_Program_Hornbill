## Interrupted-Run Recovery

1. Start a run with at least two loops.
2. Allow the first loop to complete, then terminate the application during the next
   loop only after manually confirming a safe test condition.
3. Restart the application and verify the row is `Interrupted` and does not start.
4. Confirm the previous artifact directory is displayed.
5. Select **Retry Failed**, then **Run Queue**.
6. Verify the retry starts at the next fully completed loop and produces a new run
   directory with its own diagnostics and report artifacts.

Result:

## Deviations and Evidence

- Deviations:
- The operator selected `...\Test Data\Codex Helper` rather than the initially
  proposed repository-local evidence folder. The timestamped run directory above
  contains the complete evidence set.
- One earlier queue row with DUT `None` displayed `Failed`; it produced no run
  artifacts and is not counted as a hardware-validation attempt.
- Diagnostic files:
- `logs/run.log`
- `logs/diagnostics.jsonl`
- `logs/execution_checkpoint.json`
- The two-loop run recorded three `RUNNING -> PAUSED -> RUNNING`
  transitions, 18 realtime rows, `next_loop_index: 2`, and normal completion.
- The abort run recorded `RUNNING -> STOPPING -> ABORTED`, retained parameters,
  realtime data, logs, and `next_loop_index: 1`; no report was expected after abort.
- The first current run completed all measurements but exposed a report parameter
  key mismatch. A retry then exposed graph state incorrectly owned by `TestWorker`.
  Both failures retained diagnostics and left PSU and ELoad channel 1 off.
- The corrected current run completed with nine readings, CSV/error data, two
  charts, a valid workbook, and `next_loop_index: 1`.
- The current percentage graph was regenerated with current on the x-axis and
  separate 1 V, 2 V, and 3 V series. The corrected workbook is
  `reports/CURRENT_CORRECTED_2026-07-18--13-29-02.xlsx`.
- Screenshots or photographs:
- GUI completion state and live voltage graph visually inspected on 2026-07-18.
- Issues created:
- Hardware discovery selected duplicate E36731A resources ambiguously and did not
  reach the 3458A legacy `ID?` fallback after guarded timeouts. Fixes are present
  on `fix/hardware-discovery` and covered by focused tests.
- Current report export used configuration keys instead of immutable GUI snapshot
  names and called graph methods with the worker as `self`. Both defects are fixed
  with report-generation regression coverage.
- Current percentage plots used voltage values on an axis labelled current,
  producing vertical lines. Percentage plots now sweep current horizontally and
  label each voltage series.
- Final approval:
- Pending current-mode pause/resume and abort, fault/restart scenarios, and
  Hornbill validation with the intended DUT.
